  <p>55. You are working in a local paint supply store when a customer comes in with a color sample and asks you to mix paint that will match the color she wants. Although you have received training using the color mixing machine, which included hands-on experience, you have never used it on your own with a customer watching. What would be the BEST action to take to ensure you mix the paint correctly and learn from the experience?</p>
